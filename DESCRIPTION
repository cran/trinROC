Description: Several statistical test functions as well as a function for exploratory data
  analysis to investigate classifiers allocating individuals to one of three disjoint and
  ordered classes. In a single classifier assessment the discriminatory power is compared
  to classification by chance. In a comparison of two classifiers the null hypothesis
  corresponds to equal discriminatory power of the two classifiers.
