# trinROC

This package helps to assess three-class Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) type data. It provides several statistical test functions as well as a function for exploratory data analysis to investigate classifiers allocating individuals to one of three disjoint and ordered classes. In a single classifier assessment the discriminatory power is compared to classification by chance. In a comparison of two classifiers the null hypothesis corresponds to equal discriminatory power of the two classifiers.
