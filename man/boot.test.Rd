\title{Bootstrap test for three-class ROC data}
\usage{
boot.test(x1, y1, z1, x2 = 0, y2 = 0, z2 = 0, dat = NULL,
  paired = FALSE, n.boot = 1000, conf.level = 0.95,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x1, y1, z1}{Non-empty numeric vectors of data from the healthy,
intermediate and diseased class from Classifier 1.}

\item{x2, y2, z2}{Numeric vectors of data from the healthy, intermediate and
diseased class from Classifier 2, only needed in a comparison of two
classifiers.}

\item{dat}{A data frame of the following structure: The first column
represents a factor with three levels, containing the true class membership
of each measurement. The levels are ordered according to the convention of
higher values for more severe disease status. The second column contains
all measurements obtained from Classifier 1 (in the case of single marker
assessment). In the case of comparison of two markers, column three
contains the measurementss from the Classifier.}

\item{paired}{A logical indicating whether data arose from a paired setting.
If \code{TRUE}, each class must have equal sample size for both
classifiers.}

\item{n.boot}{An integer incicating the number of bootstrap replicates
sampled to obtain the variance of the VUS. Default is 1000.}

\item{conf.level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 yielding the significance
level \eqn{alpha=1-\code{conf.level}}.}

\item{alternative}{character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of \code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}. You can specify
just the initial letter. For two sided test, notice \eqn{H0: Z = (VUS_1-VUS_2) /
(Var(VUS_1)+Var(VUS_2)-2*Cov(VUS_1,VUS_2))^{0.5}}.}
}
\value{
A list of class "htest" containing the following components:
  \item{statistic}{the value of the Z-statistic.}
  \item{p.value}{the p-value for the test.}
  \item{estimate}{a data frame containing the
  estimated parameters from Classifier 1 and Classifier 2 (if specified).}
  \item{null.value}{a character expressing the null hypothesis.}
  \item{alternative}{a character string describing the alternative
  hypothesis.}
  \item{method}{a character string indicating what type of extended
  Metz--Kronman test was performed.}
  \item{data.name}{a character string giving the names of the data.}
  \item{Summary}{A data frame representing the number of NA's as well as the
  means and the standard deviations per class.}
  \item{Sigma}{The covariance matrix of the VUS.}
}
\description{
A statistical test function to assess three-class ROC data. It can be used
for assessment of a single classifier or comparison of two independent /
correlated classifiers, using the Bootstrap test.
}
\details{
Based on the reference standard, the Bootstrap test assesses the
  discriminatory power of classifiers by comparing the volumes under the ROC
  surfaces (VUS). It distinguishes between single classifier assessment,
  where a classifier is compared to the chance plane with VUS=1/6, and
  comparison between two classifiers. The latter case tests the equality
  between VUS_1 and VUS_2. The data can arise in a unpaired or paired
  setting. If \code{paired} is \code{TRUE}, a correlation is introduced which
  has to be taken into account. Therefore the sets of the two classifiers
  have to have classwise equal size. The data can be input as the data
  frame \code{dat} or as single vectors \code{x1, y1, z1, ...}. The
  implemented methods to evaluate the \code{VUS} and \code{var(VUS),
  cov(vus.1,vus.2)} are based on the empirical model assumptions and
  resampling techniques. This means, there are no underlying distributions
  assumed in any of the classes.

\examples{
data(cancer)
data(krebs)

# investigate a single marker:
boot.test(dat = krebs[,c(1,2)], n.boot=500)

# result is equal to:
x1 <- with(krebs, krebs[trueClass=="healthy", 2])
y1 <- with(krebs, krebs[trueClass=="intermediate", 2])
z1 <- with(krebs, krebs[trueClass=="diseased", 2])
\donttest{ boot.test(x1, y1, z1, n.boot=500) }

# comparison of marker 2 and 6:
\donttest{ boot.test(dat = krebs[,c(1,2,5)], paired = TRUE) }

# result is equal to:
x2 <- with(krebs, krebs[trueClass=="healthy", 5])
y2 <- with(krebs, krebs[trueClass=="intermediate", 5])
z2 <- with(krebs, krebs[trueClass=="diseased", 5])
\donttest{ boot.test(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, paired = TRUE) }
